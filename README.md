# RHCSA(9) Testing Enviornment 

Though I've already passed the RHCSA, I thought It would be cool to automate the creation of a tesiting enviornment with Vagrant and Ansible !

#### Prequisites
1. Must have [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html), [Vagrant]([url](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads)), and [Virtual Box]([url](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)) installed
4. x86_64 Architecture 



#### Running 
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit the Vagrantfile, if you'd like ðŸ˜ƒ
3. Run `vagrant up`
4. Practice, Practice, Practice!!!


### FYI
------
If you have an M1 mac or later, this won't work :(
