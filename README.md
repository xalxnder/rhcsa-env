# RHCSA(9) Testing Enviornment 

Though I've already passed the RHCSA, I thought It would be cool to automate the creation of a tesiting enviornment with Vagrant and Ansible !

####Prequisites
1. Must have Ansible, Vagrant, and Virtual Box installed
4. x86_64 Architecture 



#### Running 
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit the Vagrantfile if you'd like
3. Run `vagrant up`


### FYI
------
If you have an M1 mac or later, this won't work :(
